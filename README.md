- Flexbox & CSS Grid

## ✨ Features
- Mobile-first responsive layout

## 📐 Responsive Breakpoints
This layout uses modern CSS Grid and Flexbox techniques (`auto-fit`, `minmax()`, and `clamp()`)
to adapt fluidly across screen sizes without explicit media queries.

The browser determines layout changes based on available space rather than fixed breakpoints.

## ♿ Accessibility
- Semantic HTML (`header`, `main`, `footer`)
- Descriptive `alt` text for images
- Decorative images marked with empty `alt=""`
- ARIA labels used only where appropriate

CSS Grid and Flexbox techniques.
